# nyzoScripts
(Unsanctioned) addons for the stock Nyzo verifier. https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier

Basic commands: https://github.com/jimtalksdata/nyzoScripts/blob/master/BASICCOMMANDS.md

**Instructions:**

1. Clone to an empty directory (NOT your verifier)
2. Manually copy the files in the correct place (anything in src goes into the verifier directory, anything outside stays wherever).
3. Follow the directions in the scripts.
4. ./gradlew build in the nyzoVerifier directory
5. Reload the supervisor

Disclaimer: I am not responsible if you break your verifier, unintentionally cause a DDoS attack, or lose your place in the cycle. Use with caution.
